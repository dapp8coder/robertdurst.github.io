Welcome to my corner of the internet.

## About Me

I am a **computer science major** and **mathematics minor** at Colby College finishing up my final year of school. Last Spring I tried creating my own programming language -- the slightly less than functional [Sailfish Programming Language](https://github.com/sailfish-lang/sailfishc). Once, I even tried to sell [Ice Cream for Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-lightning-risky-maybe-ice-cream-will-tempt). 

These days I am exploring interesting areas of **programming language** implementation and design as part of a year long thesis.

If I am not coding, I am probably at the *gym*, *surfing* the break, or planning my next trip to [Italian Homemade Company](http://www.italianhomemadecompany.com/).
