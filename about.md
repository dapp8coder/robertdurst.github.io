Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I am a **computer science major** and **mathematics minor** at Colby College and a **software engineer intern** at the Stellar Development Foundation. Last Spring I tried creating my own programming language -- the slightly less than functional [Sailfish Programming Language](https://github.com/sailfish-lang/sailfishc). Once, I even tried to sell [Ice Cream for Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-lightning-risky-maybe-ice-cream-will-tempt). 

*Why make run?*

This summer I will be honing my C++ skills at Stellar while I try to get into good enough shape to make the Colby Track team. Get it...
