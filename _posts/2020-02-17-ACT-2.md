## Learning From Failure

Last week, my official second check-in for my Spring 2020 Independent Study of Applied Category Theory, was nearly a complete bust. While I read through and took detailed notes on the first ten chapters of [Category Theory for Programmers]([https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)), I hadn't really digested any of the material. As I prepared for the meeting with my adviser, my lack of understanding became glaringly obvious. One of the topics I sought to cover was the product of categories. In a recursive manner, I groped for some understanding... "ok, a product is a universal construction"... "a universal construction is a construction"... "quite honestly, I am not even 100% sure what a construction is."

Doomed for failure, I walked into the meeting hoping some divine intervention may fill in the serious knowledge gap in the material I was about to attempt to convey to my adviser. I more-or-less fell flat on my face.

So, this week I decided to take a slightly different approach, an approach that is actually well supported by [An Invitation to Applied Category Theory]([https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316)). This week I focused on working through examples of all the concepts (the approach Brendan Fong and David I. Spivak take - thank you both, you're life savers!!!). The second change-up is to prepare a slide without visuals, but symbols that say "insert drawing here." I believe this will help by forcing me to lecture more in the style of coding interviews than class presentations... with examples and judicious whiteboard usage. I developed this skill over the course of my interview prep over the Fall, it's time to put it to good use!
