## Learning from Failure
Last week, my official second check-in for my Spring 2020 Independent Study of Applied Category Theory, was nearly a complete bust. While I read through and took detailed notes on the first ten chapters of [Category Theory for Programmers]([https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)), I hadn't really digested any of the material. As I prepared for the meeting with my adviser, my lack of understanding became glaringly obvious. One of the topics I sought to cover was the product of categories. In a recursive manner, I groped for some understanding... "ok, a product is a universal construction"... "a universal construction is a construction"... "quite honestly, I am not even 100% sure what a construction is."

Doomed for failure, I walked into the meeting hoping some divine intervention may fill in the serious knowledge gap in the material I was about to attempt to convey to my adviser. I more-or-less fell flat on my face.

So, this week I decided to take a slightly different approach, an approach that is actually well supported by [An Invitation to Applied Category Theory]([https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316)). This week I focused on working through examples of all the concepts (the approach Brendan Fong and David I. Spivak take - thank you both, you're life savers!!!). The second change-up is to prepare notes (in the form of this blog post) instead of a powerpoint. I believe this will help by forcing me to lecture more in the style of coding interviews than class presentations... with examples and judicious whiteboard usage. I developed this skill over the course of my interview prep over the Fall, it's time to put it to good use!

## Some Central Ideas

Observations are inherently "lossy", some details are dropped. Example real number rounding.

Maps f: X --> Y allow for certain observations of X.... asking which aspects of X we want to preserve. Example in the Naturals, do we want to preserve order, distance, sum, etc.?

In Category theory we want to make sure to keep control over which aspects of our system are being preserved under various observations.

Generative Effects: surprises

Example of a Generative Effect = Simple System
* objects
* observation
* operation 
* we must ask is this operation observation preserving?
	* join is not
	* order is

## Sets

Since sets will be our medium of communication for examples, and since set theory is the assumed base knowledge level, let's quickly review some of the basics of sets.

**Set:** a collection of elements
**Relation:** subset R of X x Y
**Binary relation:** subset R of X x X
**Some operations:**
* subset
* union
* intersection
* product
* disjoint union

## Partition
**Partition:** a partition of A is a set P of part labels where A is split into n parts and each element of a is in exactly one part

## Equivalence Relation
An equivalence relation on a set is a binary relation (~) with the following properties:
1. reflextive
2. symmetric
3. transitive

For a set A, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ways to partition A and the equivalence relations on A (aka the number is the same).

## Function

For sets S and T, a function is a subset of S x T  where for each element in S there exists a unique t in T with (s, t) an element in F. Denoted F: S --> T.

Function "types":
* **not a function:** an element in S maps to multiple elements in T
* **surjective:** each element in T has a corresponding element in S
* **injective:** each T with a preimage (not ever T needs a preimage), has a unique preimage
* **bijective:** both surjective and injective
* **identity:** bijective function where id(x) = x

**preimage:** "the preimage of t along F" is the subset {s in S | F(s) = t}

## Understanding a Preorder in terms of Functions

A common theme in category theory is to connect a bunch of cool concepts together -- here is the first real example.

Consider a surjective function f: A --> P were A is a set and P is any other set. The preimages, one for each element in p form a partition of A. Consider the set S := {11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23} and a partition Prt(S) := {a, b, c, d} where we have f(11) = a, f(12) = a, f(13) = b, f(21) = c, f(22) = d, f(23) = d.

## Preorders
**Preorder Relation:** for a set X is a binary relation (≤) such that:
1. x ≤ x (reflexive)
2. if x ≤ y and y ≤ z, then x ≤ z (transitive)

*Note:* this is the same as equivalence relation but without the symmetric property

**Discrete Preorder:** the only order relationships on X are of the form x ≤ x; if x does not equal y, then neither x ≤ y nor y ≤ x hold

**Booleans:** a preorder where false ≤ true

Examples:
* Natural numbers
* Reals
* Sets and cardinality

## Graphs from preorders

* a Hasse diagram "gives a presentation of a preorder (P, ≤). The elements of P are the vertices V in G, and the order ≤ is given by v ≤ w iff there is a path v --> w. Reflexitivity is captured by adding paths v --> v. Transitivity is innate in the graph/preorder.

## Partition from preorder

From a preorder, we can get a partition:
1. consider (P, ≤)
2. equivalence is defined (we will go all hand wavy and use =) by:
	* if  x ≤ y and y ≤ x then x = y
3. since we have an equivalence relation, we then have "induced" a partition on P

Draw a nice diagram here!

## Power Set
Denoted P(X) for some set X, it is the set of all subsets of X, including the empty set. 

## Ordering Partitions

Partitions are ordered by fineness. Consider Prt(A), meaning all partitions of A, a partition P is finer than a partition Q if for every part p in P, there is a part q in Q such that Ap is a subset of Aq... meaning Q is simultaneously coarser than P.
