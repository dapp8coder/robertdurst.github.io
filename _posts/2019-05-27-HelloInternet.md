## Hello Internet

![Hello!](https://media.giphy.com/media/ASd0Ukj0y3qMM/giphy.gif)

Welcome to my blog. This summer I am interning at the Stellar Development Foundation on the [core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core) team working on [reviving the fuzz test suite](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/issues/1376). Here you will find ramblings, blabberings, formal posts, and stories of my learnings as I dive into the world of trying to break shit. Don't know anything about fuzzing? Sweet, me neither -- exciting times ahead :)
