title: "Learning #2: Gnocchi, Lifting Etiquette, and Idris"

This was my first *full-ish* day in San Francisco. This morning I drove into the city with my parents and they helped me move into my nice little apt downtown. This is my first official "single" in SF. Last year I spent an entire year here and went from a small double in the Tenderloin, to a smaller, shared AirBnb near Alamo Square, to a converted room in lower SOMA. Thus, I am truly on a good trajectory!

Today I was hoping to say I learned some cool things about Agda, however I had some difficulties installing it on my machine (Manjaro) and so I eventually after many different attempts and strategies, gave up. Finally I resorted to trying out Idris, but not until 10PM, so I did not get to far in learning anything interesting. So, this post will cover three, small things I learned today instead of just one.

## Learning 1: Gnocchi is Fantastic

Mind blowing, I know! I had this absolutely wonderful gnocchi with my parents in North Beach this afternoon at a place called [The Italian Homemade Company](http://www.italianhomemadecompany.com/). This gnocchi was doused in Brow Sage Butter and literally melted in your mouth. Quite orgasmic! Below is an image of it stolen from yelp.

## Learning 2: Gym Etiquette is Not Universal

For the seasoned lifter (I guess this is me ?!?) there are a certain set of rules you live by that make your life and the lives of those around you more pleasant. I was surprised to witness a few of these being broken during my first day at Fitness SF. The infractions came against the following two rules:

1. Always rerack your weights
2. If someone is lifting more than you and is struggling to put back the db's after a hard set, give them the right of way

Thus today I learned it is a bit more of a free for all here than compared to my gym at school (Colby College) which is predominantly filled with athletes.

## Learning 3: Hello World in Idris

Starting here from scratch, altough I have comtemplated on the first chapter and a half of [The Little Typer](http://thelittletyper.com/). What interests me about Idris is it supports Dependent Types. I am not going to pretent I know what these are or even that I have the expectation of understanding them for quite a while. However, this is likely the topic of my thesis next school year, so I am getting an early start.

For those less knowledgable in the dark arts of depedent types (like me), the [Intro Documentation](http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/introduction.html) for Idris has a nice simple explanation of what I assume to be the basis:

*"In conventional programming languages, there is a clear distinction between types and values...In a language with dependent types, however, the distinction is less clear. Dependent types allow types to 'depend' on values â€” in other words, types are a first class language construct and can be manipulated like any other value."*

To Explain this, the intro gives an example of a list. This list is described as:

```
list n a
```

Where `a` is an element type, think type variable in Haskell, and `n` is the length. Thus, the type here depends on the value...

So to extend this example, they give a function which appends to lists, one of length `n` and another of length `m`. This gives the function signature:

```
app : Vect n a -> Vect m a -> Vect (n + m) a
```

Absolutely insane, am i rite!

Now something a bit less cool. Below is Hello World for Idris:

```
module Main

main : IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World"
```

Have I told you yet that this is very Haskell-y?

Anyway, that's all I have for today! As I said, these learnings will sort of be all over, yet at the same time have an all comprehensive theme (I hope). Until tomorrow!
