title: "Learning #5: Functors and Lambdas, Putting the Fun in Function"

A couple days ago I tried to implement a Haskell Functor in C++. It went ok and I got something that was kinda sorta functory-haskellish. However it wasn't great and I had a list of at least five things that needed to be improved before it was satisfactory.

Looking back at it today, I do not believe it can really be done well and I do not believe following my laundry list of improvements will get it to where I hope it will be. Thus, I called that a failure and moved on.

Speaking of functors however, there is actually a functor in C++.

***

## Actual Functor in C++

In C++, a functor is an object of a class that overrides the `()` operator, allowing it to encapsulate some logic and data, think closure. Pretty nifty and very imperative (with state and what not).

*Note: not showing an example here because I prefer lambdas.*

## There is More
It [actually turns out](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Function-Objects-Functors-in-C-Part-1) there are four types of functions, besides normal methods on classes and regular functions and such.

1. **Function Pointers**: C-style pointers to functions that can be passed around
2. **Functors, or Function Objects**: see above
3. **STL functions**: according to my second reference *"the Standard Template Library (STL) provides three types of template function objects: Generator, unary and binary functions."* Do not know a whole lot about this, will need to explore it further.
4. **Lambdas** (Yes, Thank You!): pretty cool feature allowing for anonymous functions and a utility for capturing, or enclosing, local variables

***

## Lambdas

C++ lambdas are pretty cool and in fact my CS461 project group [implemented a version of them in our Bantam Java compiler](https://github.com/robertDurst/cs461proj16). You can pass them around, invoke them immediately, return them from other functions, etc. You cannot quite go fully functional in C++, but this gets you a little bit closer.

*not true tho ^^ functional programming is great!*

Basic Lambda syntax is as so:
```
[CAPTURE_STUFF](PARAMS)->RETURN_TYPE{BODY}
```

where many of these parts are optional. [See here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/lambda-expressions-in-cpp?view=vs-2019) for more details.
